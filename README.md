# seam carving - Computer Vision 2022 - Benjamin Risse


1. Please put your image (jpg) in the same folder as the python-file `main.py` and save as `test_image_0` or change code
2. Run main.py
3. the program sequence is paused until the user makes a keyboard entry - how many seams to delete?
4. energy-map-image.jpg and smaller_image.jpg will appear in the same folder

## things I have not managed until delivery date:
* energy_map is not normalized in gray between 0 and 255
* The function `calc_seams_energie()` does not consider the image borders.
* The function `calc_minimal_seam()` does not consider the image borders as well.
* it is not the most cost-saving program


## submission:
* delivery date: 2022-01-10
